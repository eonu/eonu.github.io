# Editing

These notes were written in [Typora](https://typora.io/), a markdown editor and reader which can handle and render LaTeX. It is strongly suggested to use Typora for editing these files as it renders LaTeX, images and markdown while you type.

When you are done editing:

- Make sure any images you added are also placed in the correct directory.

- Check that all images display correctly (try to keep the image sizes reasonable), and do a print preview before committing.
- Export the markdown file to PDF (this is a feature within Typora), using the **Dropbox** theme.
- Make your pull request.
