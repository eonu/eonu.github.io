# Notes

Markdown/LaTeX formatted notes for computer science topics.

# Editing

These notes were written in [Typora](https://typora.io/), a markdown editor which can handle and render LaTeX. It is strongly suggested to use Typora for editing these files as it renders LaTeX, images and markdown while you type.

When you are done editing:

- Make sure any images you added are also placed in the correct `assets` sub-directory.
- Check that all images display correctly (try to keep the image sizes reasonable), and do a print preview before committing.
- Export the markdown file to both PDF and HTML (this is a feature within Typora), using the [**Lavender**](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Lavender/) theme.
- Ensure that the exported PDF and HTML files are both in the same directory as the markdown file.
- Make your pull request.
