My name is Edwin Onuonga. I am a graduate student in statistics and data science at the [School of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics), previously studing computer science at the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).

This is a blog that mainly aims to cover various topics in machine learning, data science, statistics and programming.

These resources are a mixture of:

- revisits or reflections on particular subjects that I came across during my studies,
- new concepts or ideas that I find interesting,
- projects that I am currently working on!
